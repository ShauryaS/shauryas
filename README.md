    My name is Shaurya and I am a rising senior at the University of Maryland College Park. I am studying to get B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Statistics. I worked as an intern on the cloud HR Service Delivery application for <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">@ServiceNow</a> and on Azure Storage for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">@Microsoft</a>. I am an Entrepreneur and Software Engineer. Currently, I am working on some stealth projects and starting some open source projects. Feel free to reach out if interested in knowing what they are. I want to continuously learn and expand my skillset so that I can continue to problem-solve. I am a fast learner and team player who is open to new opportunities and experiences.
